Change log:

[*] EXP/VTA : Better error handling and rollback.
[+] EXP : AJAX implementation of GUI in order to update VM status and IPs without refreshing the page.
[+] EXP : AJAX implementation of GUI in order to realize action over VMs without reloading pages.
[*] EXP/VTA : Improve data validators for VT Manager and Clearinghouse (Expedient) GUIs
[+] VTA/AGN : Monitoring of VM state when connection with server agent is recovered.
[*] EXP/VTA : Communication mechanism to list resources from VT Manager to Clearinghouse through hash value improved.
[+] AGN: Server agent using libvirt for almost all tasks.
[+] AGN: Server agent setup script to facilitate installation.
[+] VTA: Server agent's password settable in Server configuration web page in VT Manager.
[*] VTA : VT Manager data model completely redesign allowing:
- Networking interfaces management totally improved for servers and VMs.
- Definition of Mac Ranges and IP Ranges that servers can subscribe to.
- Mac and IP exceptions configurable inside Mac and IP ranges.
- Virtualization technology drivers to support servers not using Xen hypervisor (only Xen drivers and base class implemented so far).
[+] EXP : Expedient is able to authenticate against LDAP and push projects and slices. Due to this, Expedient requires connectivity with the LDAP and a flag was created in the settings file to enable/disable this capability. (SSH and LDAP in VMs not finished yet).
[B] Several bug fixing.
[*] Several UI improvements.
[+] EXP : Start/Stop slice in Expedient starts/stops VMs in the slice.
[+] VTA : Information message displayed to all the users of the slice if an action over a VM is performed by the Island Manager through the VT Manager.
[*] VTA : Settings configuration for VT Manager improved by isolating static and island dependent variables.

Known issues/TODOs:

[T] Resources hash mechanism does not work properly when more than one VT Manager are present.
[T] Some UI disadjustments.
[T] Information messages for the user are not displayed in the message panel if webpage is not refreshed .
[T] VTA : Action model callBackURL attribute is no longer needed in VT Manager.

Missing Features:

[-] Finishing the SSH configuration in the VMs to allow them use the LDAP. This feature will probably require a new default template for VMs and updating the agent code.
[-] VTA : AJAX in VT Manager GUI following Expedient GUI implementation.
[-] OPT : Optin Manager change topology callback to Expedient.
[-] EXP : Export VT Manager data model to VT plugin in Expedient.

v0.1RC1
--------------------------------------------------
Released: 18/04/2011

Change log:

[B] Lots of bug fixing
[*] EXP/VTA : Monitoring mechanisms to ensure connectivity between Expedient-AM and VT_AM-agent
[*] Improved monitoring(control) of the VMs and error recovery.
[+] Now virtualization plugin informs of errors during the creation, start and stop.
[*] New logos and customized UI.
[+] New "Resource visualization panel"
[*] VTA : Now links between switches and servers are shown, information is filled in VT_AM (visualization engine must be improved).
[*] Now it can be specified where the servers are physically connected (switch and port); no more hardcoded bridge information in the configuration file for the VMs
[*] Now VMs take as hostname the name of the VM.

Known issues/TODOs:

[T] VTA : Javascript bug regarding the addition of interfaces in the VT_AM (it deletes values in the form). Suggestion: first add all the interfaces needed, then put the values.
[T] EXP : Reboot machine is NOT working; this is due to an obscure bug in the libvirt library (we might have to use stop and then start method of libvirt, as sometimes reboot method in libvirt silently fails).
[T] EXP : Sometimes appears a NONE before Mgmt IP in the Resource visualization panel in Expedient. IP is correct though.
[-] EXP : New information in visualization panel for the Openflow resources.
[-] EXP/VTA : AJAX recovery of the VM status in both resource vis. panel in Expedient and VT_AM.

v0.1Alpha
--------------------------------------------------
Released: 15/03/2011

Change log:

[*] EXP : Customized version of Expedient; Apparence, simplification of the AMs selection on projects and slices (now is not necessary), plugin for Virtualization Aggregate Manager
[*] OPT : Customized version of Optin Manager: only look&feel
[*] EXP : Customized version of Expedient; Several things of apparence (look&feel, controls, visualization of topology...), simplification of the AMs selection on projects and slices (now is not necessary), plugin for Virtualization Aggregate Manager
[*] OPT : Customized version of Optin Manager: only look&feel
[*] VTA/AGN : XEN virtualization management (plugin + AM + agent)
Known BUGS and improvements:
[T] EXP : In the slice and project pages, Aggregate Managers box has to be deleted (since all the slices and projects use all AMs). In the slice a (unique) button must be put to specify Openflow controller instead of current approach
[T] VTA : Look and feel of both VT_AM and plugin needs to be improved.
[T] VTA : VT plugin fails to retrieve the status of the AM itself (it always OK status). while this is not corrected, the way to make sure Expedient is properly connected to the Virtualization AM, is to define a server in the AM (doesn't matter for the moment is not there ) try to allocate resource, and see that this servers is listed --> will be corrected soon.
[T] VTA : still doesn't correctly manage situations were connectivity problems appear between AM and Agent in the XEN server (not yet implemented) --> will be corrected soon.
[T] VTA : VT plugin still does not show servers on the topology (on process).
[T] VTA : VT_plugin does not refresh status of the VM that have pending actions in process (will be corrected via AJAX).
[T] EXP : Expedient DOES NOT use LDAP yet (LDAP code has not been merged to expedient in ofelia.development, since no LDAP server reachable for everyone is yet deployed)
[T] EXP : Expedient does not populate slice info to LDAP, and Agent still does not configure VMs to restrict login to them based on LDAP slice groups (not yet implemented).
[T] EXP : Expedient does not show in the topology the switch and host icons instead of boxes (this is indeed a bug from Stanford code that we will try to sort out).
