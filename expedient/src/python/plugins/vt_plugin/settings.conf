# Aggregate plugin, to be enabled in Expedient
#
# This is a N-set of 3-tuples:

#       
#    2. The second element is the prefix that is prepended to all urls for
#       accessing the plugin. This should be unique across all plugins and
#       applications.
#      
#    3. The third element is the absolute path to the module that should be
#       included in URLConf and that contains all the plugin's URLs.
