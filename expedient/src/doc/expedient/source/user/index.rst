Using Expedient
###############

Expedient enables rich user interfaces through a Web interface. Most things
 experimenters want to do (create slices, manage users, ...) can be done
 through the Web interface. To learn more, either go through the quick
 :ref:`user-tutorial` to learn how to create a project, add users, and create
 slices or read through the more extensive :ref:`user-manual`.
