This is a place to copy/generate user credentials for testing.
E.g. if you want to use a client you may put `alice-cert.pem` and `alice-key.pem` in here.

To auto-generate the test credentials please take a look at the `geni_trust` plugin, more specifically the `gen-certs.py` script.

CAUTION: When generating these certs, please also add the sa and ma certs to the `deploy/trusted` folder.
