    Encapsulates an XML-RPC receiver within a flask server.
    It also exports the service xmlrpc, which has the service contract outlined below.
    Along with the class reference provided by Dispatcher the contract also implies:
    - All receiver instances which can be registered via registerXMLRPC need to derrive from the Dispatcher class given below.
    - The Dispatcher is responsible for protecting private methods (starts with '_').
    - The Dispatcher is responsible for catching errors (as last resort) and converting them to reasonable messages which are passed back to the user.
    - The Dispatcher is responsible for logging if so desired by the admin.
    - The Dispatcher offers a method called {requestCertificate}, which returns the current request's SSL certificate or None, if there wasn't any.
    - The registered instance's method gets called when the XMLRPC call comes in (e.g. client sends bla(x), instance.bla(self, x) gets called).
    - These method's return value gets passed back to the user.
