 * Install the following packages with apt:

sudo apt-get install nginx python-pip xmlsec1

 * Update pip

sudo pip install -U pip

 * Get a new shell (pip caches $PATH lookups)

 * Install the following python libraries:

sudo pip install sqlalchemy Flask Flask-XML-RPC ElementTree flup blinker

 * Create /opt/ofelia/ofam/local and make it writeable by www-data

 * cd to the FOAM clone

 * Copy src/foam.conf to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   - You may want to delete the symlink to the default site if you weren't already using nginx
     as it will cause a server to be run on port 80


 * Install FOAM using setup.py:

sudo python setup.py install

 * Initialize the FOAM runtime environment

sudo -u www-data foamctl --action=setup

 * Initialize your database as the user that runs nginx:

sudo -u www-data foamctl --action=init_db

 * Get Trusted Root Certs:

sudo -u www-data wget http://www.pgeni.gpolab.bbn.com/ca-cert/pgeni.gpolab.bbn.com.pem \
       -O /opt/ofelia/ofam/local/etc/gcf-ca-certs/pgeni.gpolab.bbn.com.pem
...any other certs you want to trust...

sudo -u www-data sh -c 'cat /opt/ofelia/ofam/local/etc/gcf-ca-certs/* > /opt/ofelia/ofam/local/etc/nginx-ca-certs.pem'

 * Make an htpasswd file for both admin users and general API users
   - /opt/ofelia/ofam/local/etc/admin.htpasswd and json.htpasswd
   - {foam}/contrib/htpasswd.py will allow you to make them if you don't have apache installed

 * Run the FOAM FastCGI module as the same user that runs nginx:

sudo -u www-data python /opt/ofelia/ofam/local/sbin/foam.fcgi &

 * Start nginx:

/etc/init.d/nginx start
